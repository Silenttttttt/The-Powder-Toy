My tpt mod

This is my second attempt at making a tpt mod 

I updated a lot of stuff, it's hard to update and label everything that I do lol







Black powder(75% KNO3 15% C 10% S | 10KNO3 + 8C + 3S) decomposition =
10KNO3 + 8C + 3S =
2(K2CO3) + 1200 C = 2K + CO + O2 	
3(K2SO4) + H2O = 2K(+) + SO4(2-)
6(CO2)
5(N2)




2KNO2 + 900-950 C = 2K + N2 + 2O2
2KNO3 + 550–790 °C = 2KNO2 + O
2CO + O2 → 2CO2
K + O2 → KO2
//H2 + SO4(-2) = H2SO4
CO + H2O = CO2 + H2
Fe + CO + 550 C = CO2 + C + Fe
2KO2 + 2H2O = 2KOH + H2O2 + O2
H2SO4 + 300 C = SO3 + H2O
CO + 2H2 + heat? = CH3OH
2KOH + CO2 = K2CO3 + H2O
