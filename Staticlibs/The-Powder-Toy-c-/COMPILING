The default way of compiling TPT is with SCons: https://scons.org/pages/download.html
Python 2 is required to run SCons

The command 'scons' with no arguments will attempt to automatically detect your 
platform and all the necessary required libraries, then start compiling with 
default settings. On Linux, cross compilers will also be automatically detected 
when the --win or --mac flags are used For a list of more flags, see 
https://powdertoy.co.uk/Wiki/W/Scons_command_line_flags.html
SCons flags in the mod may vary slightly.


Compiling on Visual Studio is also somewhat supported. A project file and the 
required libraries, up to date as of December 2015, can be downloaded here:

These were created by following a similar process to the wiki guide for default 
TPT: https://powdertoy.co.uk/Wiki/W/Compiling_tpt%2B%2B_with_Visual_studio.html


This mod can also be compiled for Android. The "guide" should help but may have 
a few misc issues. To try the android compiling guide go here:

AndroidAppSettings.cfg is already set up and included with the repo.


The official android version is compiled with --nomod --touchui. --nomod will 
remove all of the mod elements and the favorites menu, to make it look more 
like default TPT (since the android port pretends to be default TPT). --touchui 
will optimize some interfaces for touchscreens. These options should be totally 
separate, but neither a touch version without --nomod nor a version with just 
--nomod are officially compiled or supported.
